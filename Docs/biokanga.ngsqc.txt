biokanga ngsqc 
NGS quality control assurance, reports duplication rates,
K-mer, and Phred score distributions

Version 4.2.0
===========================
Released December 18th 2016


Use to identify NGS readsets which may have sequencing or contaminant
artefacts requiring targeted downstream processing.

Options:

-h, --help
	This option will display the list of options and brief help as to the
	function of each of these options together with default values, and
	then terminates the process

-v, --version, --ver
	This option displays the Biokanga build version and then
	terminates

-f, --FileLogLevel=<int>
	Use this option to control the level of diagnostics written to screen
	and logfile. Currently most log messages are written at the default
	level of diagnostics (3)

-F, --log=<file>
	Use to specify the log file to which diagnostics are to be written.
	If not specified then diagnostics will be written to screen only

-q, --sumrslts=<file>
	Output results summary to this SQLite3 database file

-w, --experimentname=<str>
        Specifies experiment name to use in SQLite3 database file

-W, --experimentdescr=<str>
	Specifies experiment description to use in SQLite3 database file

-m, mode=<int>
	Processing mode:
		0 - default processing only is currently supported

-S, --strand
  	Strand specific filtering - reads are processed for duplicates with
	read orientation - default is for non-strand specific

-y, --trim5=<int>
  	Trim this number of 5' bases from each input sequence when
	loaded (default is 0, range 0..50)

-Y, --trim3=<int>
  	Trim this number of 3' bases from each input sequence when loaded
	(default is 0, range 0..50)

-s, --seeds=<int>
	Use at most this number of seed reads for duplicate identification
	Reads are loaded and duplicate counted, with the first unique
	instances of any sequence, upto specified maximum <seeds>, used to
	match other subsequently loaded reads against. Reads are only
	processed for duplicates/seeds if the individual read has all bases
	with a Phred score >= 20. The user may request between
	100,000 and 25,000,000 as the targeted maximum number of seeds with a
	default of 5,000,000.

-k, --maxkmerlen=<int>
	Number of occurrences of all K-mers from 1 to <maxkmerlen> are
	maintained and reported for every base starting from base 1 to the end
	of each read. The <maxkmerlen> can be specified between 3 and 12,
	defaulting to 5.

-K, --kmerccc=<int>
	A K-mer of this length choosen at 1/3rd of the maximum read length is
	used as a 'gold standard', and the distribution of this K-mer is
	used to determine the concordance correlation coefficient measure of
	the same length K-mers starting at all other bases in the readset.
	The K-mer length can be specified to be in the range 1 to <maxkmerlen>
	with a default of 3.

-p, --minphred=<int>
	Only accept reads for duplicate and KMer processing if their minimum
	Phred score at any base in the read is at least this threshold Phred.
	To ignor Phred scores then use '-p0'. The default is 20.

-z, --maxcontamsubrate=<int>
	Specifies maximum allowed contamimant substitution rate (bases per 25bp
	of contaminant overlap, in 1st 15bp of overlap no subs allowed).
	Default is 1, range 0 to 3

-Z, --mincontamlen=<int>
	Contaminant overlaps are only accepted if overlap is of at least this
	many bases. Default is 5, range 1 to 100.

-c, --contaminants=<file>
	Optional multifasta file containing putative contaminant sequences
	(perhaps adaptor or primers) which may be overlapping onto the reads.

-i, --inpe1=<file>
	Load single ended, or PE1 if paired end, reads from fasta or fastq
	file(s); if single ended then wildcards are allowed.

-u, --inpe2=file
	Load PE2 if paired end reads from fasta or fastq file(s), wildcards
	are not allowed and the PE2 files must be specified in matching order
	with the corresponding PE1 files.

-o, --out=<file>
	Distributions are written to CSV files using this output name as the
	filename prefix. The result specific name suffixes are:
	.contaminates.csv      Contaminates distributions
	.duplicatesdist.csv    Duplicated read distributions
	.kmerdist.csv          K-mer distributions
	.pearsondist.csv       Pearson concordance corelations
	.qscoredist.csv        Phred score distributions
	.readlendist.csv       Read length distributions
	.errfreedist.csv       Error free reads distributions
	Additionally, summary graphs are generated as SVG into the following:
	.duplicatesdist.svg    Duplicated read distributions
	.acgtdist.svg          a,c,g,t monomer distributions
	.pearsondist.svg       Pearson concordance corelations
	.qscoredist.svg        Phred score distributions
	.readlendist.svg       Read length distributions
	.errfreedist.svg       Error free reads distributions

-T, --threads=<int>
	Number of processing threads 0..n (defaults to 0 which sets threads
	to number of CPU cores, max 128)

Note: Options and associated parameters can be entered into an option parameter
file, one option and it's associated parameter per line.
To specify usage of this option paramter file to the BioKanga toolkit
components then precede it's name with '@', e.g. biokanga ngsqc @myparams.txt
