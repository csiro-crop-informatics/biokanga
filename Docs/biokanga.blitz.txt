biokanga blitz
Blat-like biokanga local aligner

Version 4.2.0
===========================
Released December 18th 2016


This subprocess is used to perform a local alignment, similar to Blat or
Blast, of query genomic sequences against a targeted assembly or
transcriptome. Seeds of a specified K-mer length are generated from the query
sequences and where these seeds align to the target then the seed alignments
are maximally extended left and right subject to the number of mismatches
encountered in the extension remaining below a threshold. These seeded
extensions are deemed as sequences and scored by length together with their
identity relative to the targeted sequence they were aligned to. When all seed
extended sequencese have been generated for a given combination of query
sequence and aligned to target sequence these extended sequences are processed
using a Smith-Waterman style dynamic programing with afine gap scoring
identifying maximally high scoring paths. Paths may contain one or more seed
extension sequences with the gaps between contained sequences due to perhaps
poorly assembled query or target sequences, genuine biological deletions or
insertions or rearrangements, or if transcriptomic alignments then exonic or
intronic gaps.

Indexing Options:

-h, --help
	This option will display the list of options and brief help as to the
	function of each of these options together with default values, and
	then terminates the process

-v, --version, --ver
	This option displays the application build version and then terminates

-f, --FileLogLevel=<int>
	Use this option to control the level of diagnostics written to screen
	and logfile. Currently most log messages are written at the default
	level of diagnostics (3)

-F, --log=<file>
	Use to specify the log file to which diagnostics are to be written.
	If not specified then diagnostics will be written to screen only

-q, --sumrslts=<file>
	Output results summary to this SQLite3 database file

-w, --experimentname=<str>
        Specifies experiment name to use in SQLite3 database file

-W, --experimentdescr=<str>
	Specifies experiment description to use in SQLite3 database file

-m, --mode=<int>
        Alignment processing mode:
		0 - Currently just the standard alignment mode is supported

-s, --sensitivity=<int>
	Sensitivity controls the defaults used for the core or seed length,
	the core delta, over occurring seed alignments, and minimum path
	length scoring thresholds.
	Sensitivity:
	0 - standard (default)
	1 - high
	2 - very high (caution alignments may take some time!)
	3 - low	sensitivity

-Q, --alignstrand=<int>
	Alignments are relative to the query sequence sense:
	0 - align both sense (+) and antisense (-)
	1 - align sense (+) only
	2 - align antisense (-) only

-C, --corelen=<int>
  	Specifies the core (seed) K-mer length to use when seeding alignment
	extensions.
	Default is 0 for auto determination, user specified range is 5..16

-c, --coredelta=<int>
 	The core (seed) delta (step) size is used to specify the
	number of bases the seed window is to be slide to the right
	along the query sequence when determining the K-mer sequence to next
	use in seeding alignment extensions.
	Default is 0 for auto determination, with a user specified range 1..50

-k, --maxocckmerdepth=<int>
  	Maximum depth, or putative seed alignments, at which to not explore
	for seed  over-occurring seed K-mer extensions. The threshold can be
	set with this parameter.
	Default is 0 for auto determination, user specified range range 100 to
	20000.

-e, --extnscorethres=<int>
  	Extension score threshold, core overlap extensions with extension
	score above this threshold are terminated; extension score += 2 if
	mismatch, extension score -= 1 if match and score > 0 (default is 12)

-p, --minpathscore=<int>
  	Minimum required alignment path score before that path will be
	reported.
	Default is 0 for auto determination, range 50..500

-a, --querylendpct=<int>
  	Minimum required percentage of query sequence length aligned before
	the path will be reported.
	Default is that at least 25% of query sequence be aligned, and the
	user specified range is from 5% to 100%.

-P, --maxpathstoreport=<int>
  	There can be many putative paths for a given combination of
	query and target sequences. Use this parameter to restrict the
	maximum number of paths which can be reported for any of the
	query to target combinations.
	The default is 10 and can be user specified to be 1 or more.

-M, --format=<int>
  	The output alignments format can be specified as:
	0 - PSL version 3 (default)
	1 - PSLX
	2 - MAF
	3 - UCSC BED

-i, --in=<file>
  	Load input query sequences to be aligned from this file

-I, --sfx=<file>
  	Align against this suffix array (kangax generated) file containing the
	targeted sequences.

-o, --out=<file>
  	Output alignments to this file in the format (PSL, PSLX, MAF or BED)
	as specified with the '-M' parameter which defaults to PSL.

-T, --threads=<int>
	Number of processing threads 0..n (defaults to 0 which sets threads
	to number of CPU cores, max 128)

Note: Options and associated parameters can be entered into an option parameter
file, one option and it's associated parameter per line.
To specify usage of this option paramter file to the BioKanga toolkit
components then precede its name with '@', e.g. biokanga blitz @myparams.txt
