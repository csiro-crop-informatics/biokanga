biokanga index generator
Version 3.7.6
===========================
Released May 11th 2015

This subprocess is used to generate a suffix array index over a targeted genome
asssembly, contigs, or transcriptomic sequences. This index is then utilised
by other subprocesses, primarily the alignment subprocess.
Indexing memory requirements are dependent primarily on the sum of all
sequence lengths to be indexed; if less than ~4Gbp then
available memory should be at least 5N, if more than ~4Gbp then available
memory should be at least 6N, where N is the sum of all sequence lengths. Thus
to index the human genome at least 16GB (5 * 3.1Gbp) of memory is required.
The generated suffix array index file will be of the same size as the required
available memory.
For benchmarking large memory machines the biokanga index subprocess can
dynamically generate a pseudorandom genome of up to 1Tbp in size and then
index this genome with no disk access operations required. This allows the
rnadom memory access latencies on machines of up to 6TB (6N) memory to be
relatively quantified under a bioinformatics workload independent of disk I/O.
The 6TB limit can easily be extended by starting multiple process instances.

Subject to memory constraints the following limits apply:
 a) Maximum of 100 million chroms/contigs fasta sequences
 b) Any individual fasta sequence must be less than 4293918720bp ( < 4Gbp) in
    length
 c) Combined total length of all fasta sequences must be less than
    1000,000,000,000bp (~1000Gbp).

Indexing Options:

-h, --help
	This option will display the list of options and brief help as to the
	function of each of these options together with default values, and
	then terminates the process

-v, --version, --ver
	This option displays the application build version and then terminates

-f, --FileLogLevel=<int>
	Use this option to control the level of diagnostics written to screen
	and logfile. Currently most log messages are written at the default
	level of diagnostics (3)

-F, --log=<file>
	Use to specify the log file to which diagnostics are to be written.
	If not specified then diagnostics will be written to screen only

-m, --mode=<int>
	Suffix array can be generated for standard processing ('-m0') or for
	bisulfite methylation processing ('-m1') or when generating a random
	genome of user specified size and then indexing same. Default is for
	standard processing

-s, --simgenomesize<int>
	When generating a random genome to be indexed then use this parameter
	to specify the size in Gbp. The default is for a 5Gbp genome but may
	be specified to be in the range of 1 to 1000Gbp.

-C, --colorspace
	If specified then suffix array is generated for use in Kanga colorspace
	(SOLiD) read alignment processing. Default is for basespace processing

-i <file>
	Build suffix array from sequences contained in the option parameter
	specified wildcarded raw fasta files. gzip'd ('.gz') files will be
	automatically deflated. Max number of input files is 100. Any
	specified input files will be ignored when generating a random genome
	for indexing.

-o <file>
	Use to specify the output suffix array file name. This is optional
	when generating a random genome for indexing.

-r, --ref=<string>
	Use to specify the reference species name

-d, --descr=<string>
	Use to more fully describe the species and origin of the source files

-t, --title=<string>
	Short title is used in BED files generated by other subprocesses

-T, --threads=<int>
	Number of processing threads 0..n (defaults to 0 which sets threads
	to number of CPU cores, max 64)

-q, --sumrslts=<file>
	Output results summary to this SQLite3 database file

-w, --experimentname=<str>
        Specifies experiment name to use in SQLite3 database file

-W, --experimentdescr=<str>
	Specifies experiment description to use in SQLite3 database file

Note: Options and associated parameters can be entered into an option parameter
file, one option and it's associated parameter per line.
To specify usage of this option paramter file to the BioKanga toolkit
components then precede it's name with '@', e.g. biokanga index @myparams.txt
